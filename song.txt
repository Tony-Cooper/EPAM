I can't help them realize what they do

Our simple deeds is not able to change the world

We can't prevent explosion of a nuclear bomb

But we can hope for the future after our death

 

Hey

Pollute the sky before you will die

Hide from the law like did it before

Store your radwaste in water for taste

Do it! Kill yourself! You need nothing else

 

Demolition, evolution, annihilation of creatures

Cause of kill, no repeal of stupid ideas

Extermination, reduction, the caution for all humans

Effectless, needless, explanation has no sense

 

My brothers-people don't understand my thoughts

They have filled with beer and rejoice in life

I can't live so! I wish to do something!

But these sad words are all that I can say now

 

Stop it! Kill them! Kill all their thoughts!

People must degrade and rejoice in trifles

 

The alcohol purpose to disarm all people

To sterilize our mind, to create obedient zombies

Drink and never think what’s going around

You’re only a pettiness from crowd with no rights

 

Fuck the alcohol! (You should not...)

Fuck the beer! (... be like them)

Fuck the drugs! (You should...)

...Make your choice!!!

 

Fuck the cigarettes! (You should not...)

Fuck the smoking! (... be like them)

Fuck all this shit! (You should...)

...Make your choice!!!
