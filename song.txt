I can't help them realize what they do

Our simple deeds is not able to change the world

We can't prevent explosion of a nuclear bomb

But we can hope for the future after our death

 

Hey

Pollute the sky before you will die

Hide from the law like did it before

Store your radwaste in water for taste

Do it! Kill yourself! You need nothing else

 

Demolition, evolution, annihilation of creatures

Cause of kill, no repeal of stupid ideas

Extermination, reduction, the caution for all humans

Effectless, needless, explanation has no sense

 

My brothers-people don't understand my thoughts

They have filled with beer and rejoice in life

I can't live so! I wish to do something!

But these sad words are all that I can say now
